# Design system example

Hi there!

This is my implementation of Button component. Many things are discussable here.
Don't look that it's SolidJS instead of React -- syntax is the same.

To open a storybook you need to do the following steps:

1. npm i
2. npm run storybook

I left comments about many things. Also you can check the docs on the storybook page.
